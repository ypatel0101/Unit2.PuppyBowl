# PuppyBowl

Welcome to PuppyBowl!



Based on Calliope's email:

You are working with the humane society to add a mini-game to their website.
The game should allow visitors to see teams of puppies compete in a "puppy bowl".
Someone has already built out the API and some of the front end.
You will be provided with the GitHub link to any existing work that has been done. 
Overall, your job is to build out a functional client side. Request data from the API, then render that data on the front end. The front end should allow the user to: 

- View the roster.
- Observe a player's details.
- Add players to the roster. (Optional)
- Etc.
